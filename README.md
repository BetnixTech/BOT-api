Multi-Language Bot SDK – REAL VERSION

This repository provides a real, cross-language bot development SDK designed for game integration. It includes fully functional examples in Haskell, Crystal, Elixir, a minimal Assembly stub, along with a Makefile and Dockerfile for easy building and testing.

Supported Languages

Haskell: Player management, leveling, inventory, AI responses, commands.

Crystal: Realistic player and bot system with commands and AI logic.

Elixir: Process-friendly player/command structures with AI.

Assembly: Minimal bot output for demonstration (x86, NASM).

Makefile: Build all languages quickly.

Dockerfile: Containerized environment with all dependencies ready.

Features – REAL BOT

Player Management: Name, level, experience, inventory.

Commands: Attack, chat, collect items, etc.

AI System: Dynamic responses for chat and actions.

Cross-language Examples: Haskell, Crystal, Elixir all runnable.

Docker Integration: Run all languages in a single environment.

Assembly Stub: Demonstrates minimal bot output for fun/historic interest.

Getting Started
1. Build via Makefile
make all


Haskell: hsbot binary. Run: ./hsbot

Crystal: crystalbot binary. Run: ./crystalbot

Elixir: Run script directly: elixir elixir/main.exs

Assembly: asm_bot binary. Run: ./asm_bot

2. Using Docker
docker build -t bot-sdk .
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app bot-sdk


All dependencies installed (ghc, crystal, elixir, nasm)

Environment ready to run bots immediately

Example Usage
Haskell
let alice = initPlayer "Alice"
let cmds = [("attack", \p _ -> name p ++ " attacks!")]
putStrLn $ executeCommand cmds "attack" alice []

Crystal
alice = Player.new("Alice")
cmds = Commands.new
cmds.register "attack", ->(p, args){ "#{p.name} attacks!" }
puts cmds.execute("attack", alice, [])

Elixir
alice = %Player{name: "Alice"}
IO.puts Commands.execute("attack", alice, [])

Notes

AI responses are dynamic and can be expanded for real game logic.

Players can gain experience, level up, and collect items.

Designed for local development and easy integration into real game engines.

Assembly version is minimal but can be expanded for embedded or low-level bots.
